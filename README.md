  <h1>Khaana’s Story</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Khaana</b> was founded in <u>2015</u> with a mission to <i>bring fresh, healthy, and locally-sourced meals</i> 
    directly to communities. What started as a small kitchen in Indianapolis quickly grew into a 
    regional foodservice company that partners with <span style="color:#2E8B57;">family-owned farms near Lafayette, Indiana</span>. 
    From the beginning, our goal has been to make nutritious food accessible while supporting 
    sustainable farming practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Growth</h2>
  <p>
    As demand for wholesome, ready-to-eat meals grew, so did we. Over the past decade, Khaana has expanded into:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Supplying meals to schools, universities, and businesses</li>
    <li>Launching delivery and catering services across Indiana and the Midwest</li>
    <li>Creating partnerships with <b>local farms</b> to ensure organic and fresh ingredients</li>
    <li>Building community programs that fight food insecurity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Milestones</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>2015 – Khaana founded in Indianapolis</li>
    <li>2017 – First expansion into catering and corporate services</li>
    <li>2020 – Launched community outreach programs during the pandemic</li>
    <li>2023 – Partnered with Purdue University for student meal plans</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>
    At Khaana, we believe food should be more than just a meal – it should be a way to build 
    stronger communities. By working with trusted suppliers like 
    <a href="https://fofarms.com/" target="_blank">Fair Oaks Farms</a>, and other local partners, 
    we ensure every box we deliver is filled with care, quality, and sustainability.
